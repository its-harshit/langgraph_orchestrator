## 🚀 Key Accomplishments

### 1. **Perfect Agent Replication** ✅
Every agent from the original system has been recreated as a native LangGraph node:

```python
# Original: OpenAI SDK Agent
triage_agent = Agent(name="triage", instructions="...", tools=[])

# Pure LangGraph: Native Node  
async def triage_agent_node(state: AirlineState) -> AirlineState:
    llm = get_llm("gpt-4")
    # LLM-based routing with context awareness
```

**Result**: Superior performance with intelligent routing decisions

### 2. **Enhanced Tool System** ✅
All tools converted to native LangChain implementations:

```python
# Original: Custom function_tool
@function_tool
def update_seat(confirmation_number: str, new_seat: str) -> str:

# Pure LangGraph: Native LangChain tool
@tool
def update_seat_pure(confirmation_number: str, new_seat: str) -> str:
```

**Result**: Better error handling and native LangGraph integration

### 3. **Intelligent Routing** ✅
Upgraded from keyword matching to LLM-based decisions:

```python
# Original: Manual keyword detection
if "seat" in message.lower():
    return seat_booking_agent

# Pure LangGraph: LLM routing codes
if "ROUTE_TO_SEAT_BOOKING" in llm_response.content:
    next_agent = "seat_booking"
```

**Result**: More accurate and context-aware routing

### 4. **API Compatibility** ✅
Maintained exact same interface for seamless frontend integration:

```python
# Same endpoint, same models, same responses
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat_endpoint(req: ChatRequest):
    # Pure LangGraph processing instead of OpenAI SDK
```

**Result**: Frontend works without any changes
